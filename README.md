# odin-recipes
In this project i will do a recipe list that will containing a summary, images, and the recipe's links.

By this project i want to show what the skills i developed throughout TOP foundations course like, creating a functional HTML code by the use of the language elements and their atributtes.

A quicky note to myself from the future: Wassup Iury, tell me how the process of creating this project was. By the way, i wish you have learned a lot with it and have fun it with. Good luck! God bless you in this new path.
